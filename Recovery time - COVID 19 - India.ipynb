About the Data\n\nPatient level COVID-19 data from India was sourced from https://api.covid19india.org/csv/. By their own description the website is a volunteer-driven, crowdsourced database for COVID-19 stats and patient tracing in India. The source for each patient's information is given as links to newspaper and magazine articles. \n\nThe data has a column each, for the date the case was announced (**Date Announced**), the current status of the case (**Current Status** among: deceased, hospitalized, recovered) and the date the status changed to the current status (**Status Change Date**). \n\nThe difference between the **Status Change Date** and the **Date Announced** was used as the time to recovery in this model. Though the **Date Announced** wouldn't be the date the patient got ill, it would be quite close to the date serious symptoms were reported. \n\nData collection could not be perfect in such a crowd sourced venture during a pandemic. Often the **Status Change Date**, was the same as the **Date Announced**. This is probably due to lack of information about when the case status changed. Attributes like gender and age are quite sparsely populated. The number of recoveries recorded were just 181 out of 17,306 observations. In most cases the current status was listed as hospitalized, probably as the recovery of the case wasn't tracked. I did not include the hospitalized cases as censored observations in my analysis as is often done in *Time To Event* modelling because they were the overwhelming majority and their timelines weren't tracked. Hence including them would reduce the insights we could glean from the few cases where timelines and other attributes like gender and age were properly logged. \n\nThe website itself states that due to the inability to track the changes in each case, they are deprecating the **Current Status** field. However, the data used in this analysis was of earlier cases (Those announced before April 19th 2020) and hence this information is sometimes available and can be used. \n\nDespite the shortcomings, we do get enough data to get information that answers some of our questions and points us in the direction of further research. We also develop a methodology for analysis that can be done if better anonymized data is available from hospitals.\n\nFor further questions about the data and my methodology please email me at gowri.thampi@gmail.com \n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id ='recovery_focus'></a>\n<a href ='#table_contents'> Return to Table of Contents </a>\n## 3.

Recovery rates by age and sex\n\nFor this analysis by age and sex, we use a slightly different approach. We use the [*Cox Proportional Hazard Model*](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-proportional-hazards-model), which estimates the hazard function, which is the instaneous probability of an event's occurence, given it hasn't occured so far. That is, for a given patient, if they haven't recovered until day k, what is the probability that they will recover on day k? \n\nThe analysis chooses a baseline group, in this case women over 50, and then assumes proportional hazards for the other groups. That is, the hazard curves for the other groups (females under 50, males under 50 and males over 50) are proportional and can't cross. That is, if an individual has an instantaneous probability of recovery at the initial time point that is twice as high as that of another individual, then at all later times the instantaneous probability of recovery remains twice as high. \n\nOnce the model is fit, we notice an extremely high p-value on the male coefficient, this means that there is very low confidence that there is a difference in the instantaneous probability of recovery between men and women. \n\nWe also notice a very low p-value in the age coefficient, showing a high level of confidence that there is a difference in the instantaneous probability of recovery of those over 50 compared to those under 50.

For eg: we could analyze the result of different medications and treatments on recovery times.\n\n5) Recovery times may follow trends similar to fatality rates, with older people taking longer to recovery. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id ='references'></a>\n<a href ='#table_contents'> Return to Table of Contents </a>\n## 9.
